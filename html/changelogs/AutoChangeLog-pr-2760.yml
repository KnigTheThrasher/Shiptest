changes:
  - {rscadd: Clipboards have a snazzy new look.}
  - {refactor: "Gave clipboards some purpose in life: Edit, rename and sort to your
      hearts' desire! Insert a pen by just clicking it in. Rapidly pick up paper by
      clicking on it with the clipboard."}
  - {rscadd: Folders have a snazzy new look. (Check out those colours!)}
  - {refactor: Split and cleaned up folder code.}
  - {refactor: Tidied up folder UI code}
  - {bugfix: Paper that's on a clipboard doesn't need to be poked to realise that
      its appearance has changed and to properly display it on a clipboard.}
  - {bugfix: You finally figured that using a stamp on a clipboard was more important
      than using the pen that's currently attached to it. Congratulations!}
  - {code_imp: Added support for preventing a pen from being removed from a clipboard.}
  - {rscadd: "Added 'biscuit' cards! They can contain documents and can only be accessed
      by cracking them open, you can't close them back. Nanotrasen now stores spare
      ID safe codes in them."}
  - {rscadd: "Placed paper cutters around the station. They're in Bridge, HoP office,
      Warden office, and Cargo."}
  - {rscadd: Now you can order paper cutters at cargo.}
  - {bugfix: Now the paper slip is actually paper.}
  - {imageadd: 'The paper slips sprite was slightly tweaked to have text lay more
      logically, added the corporate paper slip.'}
delete-after: true
