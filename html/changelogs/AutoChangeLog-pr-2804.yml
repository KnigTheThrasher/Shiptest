changes:
  - {rscadd: 'creates close_hatch, a step that mirrors open_hatch in prosthetic surgeries
      for the sake of consistency. Why you leaving that hatch open?? The final step
      before screwing to finish surgery. This affects implant removal, ipc revival,
      mechanical brain surgery, and prosthesis organ manipulation'}
  - {rscadd: 'creates manipulate_organs/mechanic, a step that swaps the necessary
      implements in synthetic surgery. Use a crowbar instead of a hemostat to remove
      any organs on an augmented limb!'}
  - {tweak: 'changes implant removal surgery to reflect the above. The new tool order
      is as follows: screwdriver, hand, wrench, crowbar, wrench, hand, screwdriver'}
  - {tweak: 'changes the (unused) ipc revival surgery to reflect the above. The new
      tool order is as follows: screwdriver, hand, multitool, inducer, hand, screwdriver'}
  - {tweak: 'changes mechanical brain surgery to reflect the above. The new tool order
      is as follows: screwdriver, hand, multitool, hemostat, hand, screwdriver'}
  - {tweak: 'changes prosthesis organ manipulation to reflect the above. The new tool
      order is as follows: screwdriver, hand, wrench (if head/chest), multitool, crowbar,
      wrench (if head/chest), hand, screwdriver'}
  - {rscadd: 'creates the Detach Prosthesis surgery, a less violent alternative to
      Amputation. This allows for prosthesis users to remove their own limbs, for
      the purposes of maintenance or just plain comfort! The tool order is as follows:
      screwdriver, hand, multitool, wrench, crowbar/wrench/hand (so you can flavor
      how you remove the limb)'}
  - {tweak: 'changes the Prosthetic Replacement surgery, renaming it to Limb Grafting
      surgery. The steps remain the same, but the name needed some retooling, as the
      procedure is much more surgically involved than its new sibling:'}
  - {rscadd: 'creates Prosthesis Attachment surgery, a less surgically involved version
      of the Limb Grafting surgery. This allows for people with prostheses to re-attach
      the limb they took off with Prosthesis Removal! The tool order is as follows:
      wrench, multitool, plug in prosthesis, hand, screwdriver'}
  - {rscdel: removes the chainsaw and synthetic arm blade from being viable prostheses.
      Left the code intact in case someone wants to do something similar in-future}
